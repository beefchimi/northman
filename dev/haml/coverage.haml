					%h2 Pretty Much Everything.
					%p Our goal is to cover more sports and activities than any other insurance package available. To do this, we’ve built a policy that covers those who want to spend their vacation time on the links or on the slopes. Whether you’re an elite athlete or just someone who wants to wander off the beaten path, you’re covered.
